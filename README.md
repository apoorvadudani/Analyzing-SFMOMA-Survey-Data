# Analyzing-SFMOMA-Survey-Data

In this project, I use the statistical programming language R to analyze survey data collected from 600 museum visitors at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA). Through statistical data mining and testing methods, including correlations, t-tests, and chi-square tests, I answer 7 research questions regarding satisfaction levels among visitors and their relationships with other factors, such as whether museum visitors come alone or with others, and whether or not they dine in at the museum restaurant. These are then used to generate valuable consumer insights and inform actionable business decisions for SFMOMA in brief executive summaries. Please see the dataset dictionary, which has been attached as a .csv file in the repository, before proceeding to read the report, available both as an R Markdown file and a PDF.
